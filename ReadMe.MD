2. Contents of the project
  This project aims to a running game of Pikachu. The game character is Pikachu and he runs along the forest with some obstacles such as Team Rocket members. The final goal of the game is to meet Ji-woo at the end and run as far as he can. The score is determined by how far the Pikachu runs. Pikachu would be better to get Thunder so he can buy the clothes for its own beauty. There is a ranking system based on the distance and the score is saved so that the player can update their own records. The player can control Pikachu by swiping the screen to the left and right. Our goal is to upload it to the Tizen Store.
